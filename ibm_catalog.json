It enables you to manage IBM Cloud Code Engine’s fully managed, serverless platform using infrastructure as code for scalable, cloud-native workloads.\n\nℹ️ This Terraform-based automation is part of a broader suite of IBM-maintained Infrastructure as Code (IaC) assets, each following the naming pattern \"Cloud automation for *servicename*\" and focusing on single IBM Cloud service. These single-service deployable architectures can be used on their own to streamline and automate service deployments through an [IaC approach](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects), or assembled together into a broader [automated IaC stack](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-stack) to automate the deployment of an end-to-end solution architecture.",
